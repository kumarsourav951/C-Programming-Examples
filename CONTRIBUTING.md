# MEASURES TO REDUCE SPAM
# SPAMMY PULL/MERGE REQUESTS WILL BE LABELED AS “SPAM.”
*Maintainers:* label spammy requests “spam” and close them. PR/MRs labeled “spam” won’t count toward Hacktoberfest. Contributors with 2+ spammy PR/MRs are disqualified.<br>

# PULL/MERGE REQUESTS MUST BE APPROVED BY A MAINTAINER.
Maintainers accept PR/MRs by merging them, labeling them “hacktoberfest-accepted,” or giving them an overall approving review. Accepted PR/MRs enter a 7-day review window, during which approval can be revoked by the maintainer or by our team.<br>

# BAD REPOSITORIES WILL BE EXCLUDED.
PR/MRs should be useful to maintainers. Repos that encourage simplistic PR/MRs (like adding a name or profile to a list or arbitrarily curating content) will be excluded from Hacktoberfest. Remember: quantity is fun, quality is key.<br>

# AVOID SUBMITTING LOW-QUALITY PULL/MERGE REQUESTS.
Hacktoberfest is about contributing meaningfully to open-source projects. Here are some examples of low-quality pull/merge requests that won’t count towards Hacktoberfest.<br>

Automated pull/merge requests: scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace, fix typos or optimize images.<br>
Disruptive pull/merge requests: taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a pull request.<br>
Anything that a project maintainer flags as spam.<br>
Anything that looks like an attempt to duplicate your pull request count for October.<br>
Multiple pull/merge requests for the same issue that are unnecessary -for example five PR/MRs to remove a stray whitespace is not.<br>
